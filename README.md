-  Secure your API with Bearer token authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
-  Explore Swagger for API documentation and testing.

Technologies

-  ASP.NET Core: A modern, open-source framework for building web APIs and applications in C#.
-  C#: A general-purpose, object-oriented programming language.
-  Entity Framework Core (likely used in the course): A lightweight object-relational mapper (ORM) for interacting with databases in ASP.NET Core applications.
-  JWT (JSON Web Token): A popular standard for secure authorization by encoding claims (information) about a user in a compact, digital signature.
-  Swagger: An open-source framework for generating interactive API documentation.

Skills Learned

-  Building web APIs using ASP.NET Core.
-  Designing and developing RESTful APIs.
-  Implementing CRUD operations for data persistence (likely using Entity Framework Core).
-  Securing APIs with Bearer token authentication using JWT.
-   tilizing Swagger for API documentation and testing.
